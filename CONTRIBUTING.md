Hi there :wave: 

Thanks for taking an interest in contributing to Phase!

If you have any questions, comments, bug reports, feature requests or ideas feel
free to open a [new Issue](https://github.com/reed-jones/phase/issues/new). 

If you want to contribute code, fork the repo and start hacking! PR's can be made 
right to master. If you get started on a feature but get stuck, open the PR and 
maybe I can help out. If you aren't sure if the feature is a good fit for the project, 
maybe open an issue to start a discussion first, otherwise you could always just 
implement it and use your own fork. (PR's _are_ appreciated though :slightly_smiling_face:)

If you find something wrong with the [docs](https://phased.dev). They live over 
[here](https://github.com/reed-jones/phase-docs) however you can also click the 
_Edit This Page_ button at the bottom of each page.
